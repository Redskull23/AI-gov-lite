# AI-GOV-Lite 🛰️
An open-source framework for AI-driven **data classification**, **sensitivity tagging**, and **zero-trust policy enforcement** — inspired by enterprise data governance systems.
## 🔍 Purpose
This project helps technical product managers, data stewards, and governance professionals demonstrate how to:
- Automatically scan tables for sensitive data (e.g. PII, CUI, ITAR)
- Tag data with context-aware logic and regex/LLM support
- Generate policy files based on classification tags
- Validate tagging decisions via a human-in-the-loop interface
